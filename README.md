The module can be installed into a virtual environment or directly into your local pc or a project. The cobe base lives on [github](https://github.com/Basillica/micropsi).

To install from the github reposition, use the command

This works either from a virtual environment, locally or inside a regular project.
Also from inside project, the module can be installed using the command
